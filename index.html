---

# The bad guy: Fagin
--

- “a very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair.”
--

- Fagin is a crimelord
--

- Fagin uses these children to steal hankerchiefs off others
---

# Fagin is a Jew!
--

- Charles Dickens calls Fagin "the Jew" more than a few times
--

- “In the first 38 chapters of Oliver Twist there are 257 references to 'the Jew' against 42 to 'Fagin' or 'the old man'."
--

- "According to medieval thinking, 'the Jew' was deemed the epitome of evil and regarded as a literal incarnation of the devil."
--

- Many Jewish people see this as Anti-Semitism and a lot have spoken out ever since the book was published
---

# Challenging Oliver Twist
--

- Ever since the book was published, Jews saw the book as a discrimination against them
--

- "He changed many of the Fagin references from ‘the Jew’ to simply ‘Fagin’ or ‘he.'"
--

- But Fagin was still Jewish *and* a criminal
--

- The discrimination surrounding Fagin continued to grow, especially during WWII
---

# Challenging Oliver Twist
### Rosenberg v. Board of Education of the City of New York
--

- In 1949, "A group of Jewish parents in Brooklyn, New York challenged the use of Oliver Twist and The Merchant of Venice in senior high school literature classes"
--

- “because they tend to engender hatred of Jew as a person and a race”
---

# Challenging Oliver Twist
### Rosenberg v. Board of Education of the City of New York
--

- ruled that “public interest in a free and democratic society does not warrant or encourage the suppression of any book at the whim of any unduly sensitive person or group of persons”
--

- "a book could be suppressed only if it showed it was shown to be ‘maliciously written for the apparent purpose of promoting and fomenting a bigoted and intolerant hatred against a particular racial or religious group."
---

# My Opinion
--

- Although the book has some Anti-Semetic descriptions, it is not a bad read
--

- The parts with 'the Jew' should be censored
